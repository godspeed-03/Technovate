# React + Vite Project Documentation

This project provides a minimal setup for building React applications using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), featuring Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules to ensure code quality.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to get React up and running with Vite's fast build performance and HMR support. Vite improves the development experience by speeding up the time it takes to start and compile React applications.

### Features

* **Fast Refresh**: Instant updates on save without losing React component state.
* **Minimal Setup**: Just the essential configurations for a smooth development experience.
* **ESLint Support**: Includes some basic ESLint rules to ensure consistent code style.

## Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are included for handling Fast Refresh:

1. **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**
   - Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
   - Provides complete support for React, JSX, and new React 17+ JSX transforms.

2. **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**
   - Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
   - A much faster alternative to Babel that offers the same features with better performance.

To start working with this project, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:
